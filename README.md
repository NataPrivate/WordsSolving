# WordsSolving
MTP_Lab6
The project divides words from file into 3 categories:
- simple
- partly concatenated
- fully concatenated (explicitly formed with other words)
Also it allows to get 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... n-th by max length fully concatenated words.

The efficacy was checked with full list of words - words.txt, but in tests - shortened words0.txt.
